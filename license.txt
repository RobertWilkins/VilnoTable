This is a copy of the same license that Javascript DRAW has been available under since
2023.
While this license is not tailored for Vilno Table, Vilno Table is available under 
this license for a limited time period. Vilno Table is available under this license 
UNTIL a new version of Vilno Table is available with a different license and not this
license.

This is an effort to balance two priorities: I want to encourage various research 
groups, obviously in academia, but also in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, 
to experiment with this product design. Also, Vilno Table provides financial benefits 
to pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporations, and a software license in the future 
will reflect that.

The rest of the license follows, the same license that has been available for Javascript 
DRAW in 2022, 2023 , and today :

###########################################################################

A "Large Entity" is a corporation with two million USA dollars or more in annual revenue. 
A "Small Entity" is an individual or group of people or non-profit or corporation that is 
not a "Large Entity".
Unless otherwise clarified, in this license, when I say "you", I am assuming you are a
small entity.


If you are a "Small Entity", this license grants you permission to use this 
Javascript DRAW tool, a software product, free of charge. You can kick the tires, you can
 test it, you can learn it, you can use it for teaching, you can use it while providing 
web development services for which you are paid or by which you make a profit.

You can sell services related to this product, you cannot re-sell (at a non-zero price) 
the product to other small entities.

You may not re-sell the product to large entities without contacting me first. 
You may not give the product to large entities either.

At this time, no all-purpose license for large entities has been drafted (not yet). 
Until then, you are free to use the product to sell web site development services to 
large entities. 
You are not responsible at this time for maintaining customer records that distinguish 
between small entities and large entities.

Redistribution of the code, or any part of the code, without the copyright information 
that fully identifies the author and owner of the code is a very serious copyright 
infringement.

In general, you are free to use this product while providing web development services 
to other small entities.

At this time, you may use this product while providing web development services to large 
entities, however future licenses I attach to the Javascript DRAW product might clarify 
the conditions under which you (a small entity) provide services to a large entity. 
Such clarifications will not be retroactive.

If you are a large entity, this license grants you no permissions. This license is for 
small entities.

If you are a large entity, you may use this software only for the purpose of 
"kicking the tires", for the purpose of experimentation and testing. Beyond that purpose 
you need another license, which will be available at a reasonable price.
