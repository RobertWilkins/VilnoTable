This is the doc subdirectory for the VilnoTable repository.
Although Vilno Table was created over 10 years ago, prior to today,
Vilno Table was not uploaded to my GitHub account, until now
( Wednesday , August 23 2023 )
Documentation will be put in this directory explaining why Vilno Table
is being added to my GitHub account at this late date, and what license
Vilno Table will be available under.
Expect the licensing to be similar to the license I recently chose for 
the Javascript DRAW project, but there will be 2 different licenses, 
one for most users, another for users employed in the Pharmaceutical,
Biotech, and medical devices industry.

One of the reasons for posting Vilno Table to my GitHub account is 
not directly related to the marketing of Vilno Table, but to the use
of my GitHub account for advertising my entire spectrum of 
accomplishments, and Vilno Table and Vilno Data Transformation are 
two very important components of my resume.
In other words, those who are trying to evaluate my whole resume, 
will be free to, for the purpose of evaluating my skills and 
accomplishments, take the software for a test-drive, to test and 
validate the software for the purpose of evaluting my skills.
To use Vilno Table in a production environment, for example for 
doing the CSR or the QA for a CSR in a clinical trial reporting 
environment, you will need a license where I get compensated.
